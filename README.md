Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won't see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree, you'll miss the entire forest.  
Don't be preoccupied with a single spot. See everything in its entirety effortlessly. That is what it means to truly "see".

You need unclouded lens to awaken what is already whole.
